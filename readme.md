## There are 2 main files:<br>
- The first one is our initial implementation. A lot of complicated stuff, such as upgrading the factory. Roads are being upgraded, but people still go on them, which makes travel times slow; they don't even avoid them. The traffic jam implementation was wrong, also.

- The second one is the FINAL VERSION

## Logics
For our implementation, you will initially have a budget for 15 days of running the system. <br>
After 15 days without RE-INVESTMENT (through upgrading roads) -> YOUR ECONOMY WILL CRASH.

==> This shows how the economy works, thus contributing to GDP

Else use the good produced as a factor to see which level of "road" should be best for your simulation.

You can play this forever to figure out the best way to upgrade roads that lead to the best number of goods in the shortest amount of time.
